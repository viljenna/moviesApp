# moviedb

This is Next.js-app made with TypseScript. I have used Tailwind and DaisyUI for appearance and MongoDB for database. I have also used Supabase for authentication.

Here user can see 40 movies on page and oredr them alphabetically or by release date. User can also see more information about the movie by clicking it. There are also categories that can be used and those show also 40 movies with selected category. User can sign up and log in with the app and make own lists of movies seen.
